**Notice**
1. For any data to be input to or output by your code. Please try to store them in dataset folder instead of storing 
them along with the source code. This can help us view the data and prepare our final reports without having our data 
scattering around
2. For the code modules, it is encouraged to (i) show the required steps about how to replicate your results; 
(ii) any implementation details that worth readers' notice.
3. To better manage this repository and avoid the headache of managing commit conflicts, it is advised to create and 
work on your own `feature` branch when you know someone else is also working on the same module. Branch protection
is available to the paid users only on Github.
3. Please keep the commit tree clean - preferably always rebase to the head of `main` before you push your `feature` 
branch
